# Endless Protocol Privacy

Privacy is a core principle of Endless Protocol.  
The system integrates advanced cryptographic methods such as:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to verify data without revealing sensitive information.  
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)** to give users full control over their digital presence.  
- **Data Sovereignty** ensuring creators and communities own their data.  

This privacy-first approach allows AI agents to operate securely and build trust at scale.
