# Endless Protocol Tokenomics

The Endless ecosystem introduces a native token to power its economy:

- **Utility**: Access to AI infrastructure, agent operations, and platform services.  
- **Incentives**: Rewards for contributors, validators, and creators.  
- **Governance**: Token holders can propose and vote on protocol upgrades.  
- **Staking**: Mechanism to secure the network and align long-term participants.  

The tokenomics are designed to ensure sustainability, decentralization, and growth of the ecosystem.
