# Endless Protocol Architecture

Endless Protocol is designed with multiple layers:

1. **AI Infrastructure Layer** – compute and frameworks for agentic AI.  
2. **Data & Privacy Layer** – leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for trust and safety.  
3. **Incentive Layer** – tokenized mechanisms to align contributors and users.  
4. **Applications Layer** – SocialFi, DeFi, and creative tools powered by Endless agents.

This modular design allows developers to plug in and build seamlessly.
